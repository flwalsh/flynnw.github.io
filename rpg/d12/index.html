    <h1 id="the-simple-d12-system">The Simple d12 System</h1>
<h4 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h4>
<p>Simple d12 is a minimalist, setting-agnostic, abstractly realistic system. It is designed for ease of character generation and minimal player downtime. Combat is authentically fast-paced, rushed, and lethal.</p>
<h2 id="character-generation">Character Generation</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Determine a setting-appropriate background, consisting of a character&rsquo;s:</p>
<ol>
<li>upbringing, including:
<ul>
<li>nationality</li>
<li>social class</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>education (formal or informal, if any)</li>
<li>previous endeavors (if any)
<ul>
<li>e.g. military service</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a vocation, specialized to the period. Vocations include but are by no means limited to:</p>
<p>Actor, Bureaucrat, Crafter, Criminal, Doctor, Engineer, Entrepreneur, Farmer, Investigator, Merchant, Police, Politician, Priest, Scientist, Soldier, Spy</p>
<p>Specialized, these could be alchemist or xenobiologist (scientist), trauma surgeon or plague doctor (doctor), landsknecht or bomb disposal specialist (solider), machinist or fletcher (craftsman).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allocate 18 points between analytical (<em>An</em>), emotional (<em>Em</em>), and physical (<em>Ph</em>) aptitudes. Values are roughly interpretable as below (0 in any means death).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>Determine your character&rsquo;s values, goals, appearance, etc. and describe what is apparent to others.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="taking-actions">Taking Actions</h2>
<p>For any action where success cannot be assumed, roll 1d12.</p>
<ul>
<li>+1d12 if trained in or familiar with the task, as would be appropriate for the character&rsquo;s background, vocation, or from prior game experience.</li>
<li>For social interactions, this could mean being part of the same class or subculture as a person you&rsquo;re trying to convince or deceive.</li>
<li>+1d12 if prepared, e.g. an aimed shot, a strike after a feint, or working without any time pressure.</li>
<li>Training and preparation are subject to GM discretion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>target</em> of a roll is the character&rsquo;s most relevant aptitude (<em>An</em>, <em>Em</em>, or <em>Ph</em>).</p>
<p>A die passes if its value is equal to or below the target and fails if greater. For actions that aren&rsquo;t attacks, the outcome of a roll is as follows:</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>Combat proceeds in rounds corresponding to ~2-3 seconds in game time.
In order of lowest to highest <em>Em</em>, players describe two actions.
This means that players can act with awareness of actions being performed by lower <em>Em</em> characters.
The GM should determine NPC actions at appropriate times, describing what may be apparent.
Enemies often have fractional <em>Em</em> to avoid ties.
Actions that are not immediately clear to all may be communicated via note.</p>
<h4 id="optional-rule">Optional rule</h4>
<p>To replicate the intensity of combat and increase the pace of the game, players have 3<em>An</em> seconds to describe their turn.
The GM may, though is not obligated to, ask clarifying questions.</p>
<h4 id="example-turn-descriptions">Example turn descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Smash the guy with my axe&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Prepare a dodge if anything comes at me&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Inquiry while I leap over the bridge&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Pary if attacked, otherwise aim my shot&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>All actions and results, including rolls, are then resolved simultaneously.</p>
<p>Actions may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inquiry</strong> You may ask <em>An</em>/3 questions about the scenario to the GM.</li>
<li><strong>Attack</strong>, e.g., shooting, punching, and stabbing, generally a <em>Ph</em> roll.</li>
<li><strong>Preparation</strong>, primarily aiming or feinting, which adds a preparation d12 to the next specific action.
<ul>
<li>You may stack <em>An</em>/2 preparations. (<em>An</em> - Actions -1 )</li>
<li>A preparation die enables a conditional action, although additional .</li>
<li>Preparations must be used on the next related sequence of actions. E.g., you could have 4 preparations, use 2 on the parry and 2 on the riposte. Or say 3 on a dodge and one on the <em>Ph</em> roll to. If you dodge without using your preparation, your prep resets.</li>
<li>An <em>An</em> roll is required to avoid friendly fire into a melee. Preparation dice may be used toward this and an attack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Evasion</strong>, including diving for cover, dodging backward, falling prone, blocking, or parrying. Mechanically, a <em>Ph</em> roll where each passing die negates a successful attack die that would otherwise hit.
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not possible to evade twice in one round, but one can spend an action to prepare an evasion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Movement</strong>, 4m, 8m if moved the previous round.
<ul>
<li>Two actions moving is equivalent to 12mph</li>
<li>On a battle mat, 1 square/hex = 1m is recommended</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another action simple enough you can describe and perform it in the alloted time.
<ul>
<li>includes reloading</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g., a player may duck behind a wall and fire (evasion + attacking) or simply stand up and unload (attacking twice). A swordsman can parry (evasion) while backing up tower stairs (movement) or feint (preparation) and lunge at the enemy (attack).</p>
<p>Without armor or other modifiers, each successful attack die deals one point of damage to a target&rsquo;s <em>Ph</em>. <em>Ph</em> can be regenerated using medical technology or resting for a realistically long time.</p>

<p>Various weapons may add to attack roll aptitudes or increase the number of dice rolled.</p>
<h4 id="example-weapons">Example Weapons</h4>
<p>Many weapons have limited capacity (in # of attacks) after which they require a reload (in # of actions).
Ranged weapons become less accurate at intervals listed in meters.</p>

<p>Basic armor could be a chain shirt or a bullet proof vest. Full armor would be plate mail or riot gear.</p>
<h4 id="cover">Cover</h4>
<p>Attacking a target behind cover reduces the attacker&rsquo;s effective aptitude by -2 for improvised cover (walls, windows, hostages) and -3 for fortifications (castle crenelations, pillboxes, etc.) Shooting through cover may be possible if enough dice hit at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
<p>Attacking a single-moving target lowers effective aptitude by 1. A double-moving target is -2 to hit.</p>
<h3 id="combat-target">Combat Target:</h3>

<h3 id="example-combat-sequence-1">Example Combat Sequence 1</h3>
<p>Two swordsmen, Ay and Bee, circle each other in one-on-one combat.
Bee is <em>8 5 6/6</em> and Ay is <em>5 4 9/9</em>.
They weild longswords, which are +1/+3d.</p>
<p>Ay has 2 ac. and 2 pr.
Bee has 3 ac. and 4 pr.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<p>Ay has to go first, with 2 actions.
Ay spend 2 <em>Pr</em> to prepare for engagement (optional evasion), studing Bee&rsquo;s actions as they slowly circle.</p>
<p>Bee, with three <em>Ac</em>, prepares 2 <em>Pr</em> for engagement (optional evasion). Also asks: what is Ay&rsquo;s Ph?</p>
<p>Round 2</p>
<p>Having fully prepared, Ay is ready to strike.
Ay decides to recklessly attack, using both actions to do so, spending 2 <em>Pr</em> on the first.</p>
<p>Bee knows that Ay is attacking and a better swordsmen, prepares twice more and evades.</p>
<p>Resolution:</p>
<p>Ay attacks with 1 + 1 (training) + 3 (weapon) + 2 (<em>Pr</em>) = 7d12, trying to roll under 9 + 1 = 10. 6 succeed.</p>
<p>Ay attacks with 1 + 1 (training) + 3 (weapon) = 5d12, trying to roll under 9 (<em>Ph</em>) + 1 (weapon) = 10. 4 succeed.</p>
<p>Bee parries with 1 + 1 (training) + 3 (weapon) + 4 (<em>Pr</em>) = 9d12, trying to roll under 6 (<em>Ph</em>).
4 succeed.</p>
<p>1 successful die from each attack is negated by Bee&rsquo;s basic armor, who takes a total of 8-4=4 damage.</p>
<p>The first blow is mostly deflected, but gashes Bee. However, Bee is unprepared for the second which sends them to the floor.</p>
<p>Lesson: no matter how smart you are, don&rsquo;t go up against an elite swordsman if you are merely average.</p>

<p>If magic (including deities) exist in the setting, it should be truly magical, i.e. mystical, poorly understood, and most importantly dangerous. It should not be mechanical or predictable in any way.</p>
