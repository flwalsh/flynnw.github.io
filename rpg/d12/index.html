    <h1 id="the-simple-d12-system">The Simple d12 System</h1>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>Simple d12 is a minimalist, setting-agnostic, abstractly realistic system. It is designed for ease of character generation and minimal player downtime. Combat is authentically fast-paced, high pressure, and lethal.</p>
<h2 id="character-generation">Character Generation</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Determine a setting-appropriate background, consisting of a character&rsquo;s:</p>
<ol>
<li>upbringing, including:
<ul>
<li>nationality</li>
<li>culture</li>
<li>social class</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>education (formal or informal, if any)</li>
<li>previous experience (if any)
<ul>
<li>e.g. military service</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a vocation, specialized as appropriate to the setting. Vocations include but are by no means limited to:</p>
<p>Actor, Bureaucrat, Crafter, Criminal, Doctor, Engineer, Entrepreneur, Farmer, Investigator, Merchant, Police, Politician, Priest, Scientist, Soldier, Spy</p>
<p>Specialized, these could be alchemist or xenobiologist (scientist), trauma surgeon or plague doctor (doctor), swordmaster or sniper (solider), machinist or fletcher (craftsman).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allocate 18 points between analytical (<em>An</em>), emotional (<em>Em</em>), and physical (<em>Ph</em>) aptitudes. Values are roughly interpretable as below (0 in any means death).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>Determine your character&rsquo;s values, goals, appearance, etc. and describe what is apparent to others.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="taking-actions">Taking Actions</h2>
<p>For any action where success cannot be assumed, roll 1d12.</p>
<ul>
<li>+1d12 if trained in or familiar with the task, as would be appropriate for the character&rsquo;s background, vocation, or from prior game experience.
<em>Optional rule</em>: each character can specialize in one task, for which they roll 2 training dice. E.g. rapier dueling, sniping, computer hacking, driving cars.
<ul>
<li>For social interactions, this could mean being part of the same class or subculture as a person you&rsquo;re trying to convince or deceive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>+1d12 if prepared, e.g. an aimed shot, a strike after a feint, or working without any time pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Training and preparation are subject to GM discretion.</p>
<p>The <em>Under</em> of a roll is based on the character&rsquo;s most relevant aptitude (<em>An</em>, <em>Em</em>, or <em>Ph</em>). A die passes if its value is below the <em>Under</em> and fails if it is equal or greater. For most out of combat actions, the outcome of an attempt is as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>passing dice</th>
<th>result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>failure, something may go wrong</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>success with a caveat</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>success</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3+</td>
<td>critical success</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>However, certain tasks may have additional dice requirements, e.g. picking a lock may have a difficulty of (-1d), meaning that 1 fewer die is available than would otherwise be. This would mean that an amateur has no hope of picking a box&rsquo;s lock under time pressure, but might if they could take it home (preparation). However, in this case their greatest hope would be &ldquo;success with a caveat&rdquo; , e.g. a trap might be activated or their tool may break off inside it.</p>
<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
<p>For simplicity&rsquo;s sake, money should be denominated in a setting appropriate currency (e.g. silver, pence, sesterii, credits, quants) approximately equivalent to USD/EUR with prices derived from real world data.</p>
<h2 id="magic">Magic</h2>
<p>If magic, including deities, exist in the setting, it should be truly magical, i.e. mystical, poorly understood, and most importantly dangerous. Magic should not be mechanical or predictable in any way.</p>
