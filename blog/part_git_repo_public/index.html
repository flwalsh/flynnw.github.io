    <h1>Publicizing part of a git repo with hard links</h1>
    <p>I use private git repositories to sync and back up most of my scripts, settings, and notes. However, there are various files I&rsquo;d like to make available for colleagues or application reviewers.</p>

<p>After unsuccessfully playing around with submodules and branches as the internet seems to recommend, I found it easiest to create a new public repository in a separate directory in which I simply hard link to any files I want public. (Git will sadly not follow symlinks.)</p>

<p>E.g.,</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir public_scripts
ln ~/bin/script_to_publish.py ~/public_scripts/
cd public_scripts
git init
git remote add origin &lt;public_repo.git&gt;
git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>A catch is that it&rsquo;s not possible to hard links directories. Any directory structure will have to be manually recreated, but this has been no issue for me. The hard links must also be set up on one machine that cannot pull.</p>
